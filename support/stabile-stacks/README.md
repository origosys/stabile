# Stabile Stacks
Stacks are pre-packaged collections of virtual images, software and declarative configuration directives for the Origo Stabile infastructure platform.

Origo Stabile is a software platform for managing virtual servers and associated infrastructure.
Stabile aims to make it very easy to manage VM's, storage and networking from a web UI, through an API and from a command line client.

One of the unique things about Stabile is the ability to run pre-packaged "stacks". A Stabile stack consists of a set of imaster mages with pre-configured software and specifications, which together define a system of servers. Stacks typically offer a specific service like e.g. a mail service or a file service.

The source code and scripts for building the stacks we distribute with Stabile are available here. Instructions for building a stack are available here: https://www.origo.io/info/stabiledocs/guides/building-a-stack/
