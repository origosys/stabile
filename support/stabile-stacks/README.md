# Stabile Apps
Apps for Origo Stabile.

Origo Stabile is a platform for managing virtual servers and associated infrastructure.
Stabile aims to make it very easy to manage VM's, storage and networking from a web UI, through an API and from a command line client.
Stabile consists of a hardware platform, the **Engine**, and a software stack, **Stabile**.

One of the unique things about Stabile is the ability to run pre-packaged "apps". A Stabile app consists of a set of imaster mages and specifications, which together define a system of servers. Apps typically offer a specific service like e.g. a mail service or a file service.

The source code and scripts for building the apps we distribute with Stabile are available here.
